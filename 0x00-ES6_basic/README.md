# 0x00-ES6_basic


ECMAScript 6, commonly known as ES6, is a major update to the ECMAScript standard, the ECMAScript 6 specification, and as a JavaScript application programmer, it provides new functionality.

Here are some key features introduced in ES6:

Classes: Introduced a class-based object-oriented programming to JavaScript.

Constants: Introduced new constants to define values that cannot be reassigned.

Arrow Functions: A more concise way to write function expressions, introducing arrow functions with the 'fat arrow' syntax.

Template Literals: A more intuitive way to define string literals, introducing template literals with multi-line and embedded expression support.

Destructuring: A more convenient way to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects, introducing destructuring assignment.

Promises: An improved way to handle asynchronous operations, introducing promises for more robust and manageable asynchronous programming.

Let and Const: Introduced block-scoped local variables to complement the existing function-scoped variables.

Modules: Introduced a module system to make it easier to manage dependencies between modules.

These features have been gradually adopted by major browsers, allowing developers to utilize the new functionalities. However, as these features were not natively supported in Internet Explorer, it became crucial for developers to consider browser compatibility.
